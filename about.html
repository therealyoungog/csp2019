        Friends
    </h2>
    <p>
        An important aspect in my life is my friends. Any recreational activities I do, I make sure they tag along. Although they may be a burden sometimes, I am always glad to have them to accompany me.

        Sports
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sports have always been my go to for stress relief. Over the years I have participated in a multitude of sports, including: Swim, Mountain biking and Mixed Martial Arts. I currently swim for RBHS on the varsity team, doing the 50 and 100 Free along with some relays. As the team captain I also try to ensure everyone is well prepared for meets.  As for MMA, even though I lack the time to compete, I still train for it on my spare time.

        Video Games
    </h2>
    <p>
        Playing video games has always been essential in wasting my time and supplying me with hours of fun. I enjoy all genres of games, including: RPGs, Action and Adventure and, strategies games. My favorite game of all time would have to be either Fallout 4 or Skyrim.
